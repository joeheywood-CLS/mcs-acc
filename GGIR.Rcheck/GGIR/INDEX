GGIR-package            A package to process multi-day raw
                        accelerometer data
data.calibrate          Example output from g.calibrate
data.getmeta            Example output from g.getmeta
data.inspectfile        Example output from g.inspectfile
g.analyse               function to analsyse meta-data generated by
                        g.getmeta and g.impute
g.binread               function to read binary files as produced by
                        the accelerometer named 'Genea', not to be
                        confused with the 'GENEActiv' (see package
                        GENEAread for this)
g.calibrate             function to estimate calibration error and make
                        recommendation for addressing it
g.getmeta               function to extract meta-data (features) from
                        data in accelerometer file
g.impute                function to identify invalid periods in the
                        meta-data as generated by g.getmeta and to
                        impute these invalid periods with the average
                        of similar timepoints on other days of the
                        measurement
g.inspectfile           function to inspect accelerometer file for
                        brand, sample frequency and header
g.part1                 function to load and pre-process acceleration
                        files
g.part2                 function to analyse and summarize pre-processed
                        output from g.part1
g.part3                 Detection of sustained inactivity periods as
                        needed for sleep detection in g.part4.
g.part4                 Labels detected sustained inactivity periods by
                        g.part3 as either nocturnal sleep or daytime
                        sustained inactivity
g.plot                  function to generate a plot for quality check
                        purposes
g.shell.GGIR            Shell function for analysing a accelerometer
                        dataset.
